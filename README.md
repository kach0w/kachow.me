<b> Hello, here is my website! </b>
<p> I have been trying to add new things to it such as Email using the Gmail API, a stopwatch for the end of the year (which I will expand on), and other things such as a directory for showing off things I have created. </p>
<br>
<p> Note: The Gmail API program is only in a testing phase, since Google only lets <b>https</b> sites use the Oauth for any gmail users. </p>
